# LifeHack_TeamPowerpuffs

Project Name: Team Powerpuffs (039)

In consideration of the ‘Social’ theme, our group realised that there was a gap in the market for technological tools that are aimed at developing stronger bonds with one’s family. Social media and communication resources are widely targeted at teenagers and young adults to be used in conjunction with their friends and colleagues. However, the core unit of a person’s primary support is usually their family.

Hence, we decided upon creating FamJam, an app that improves family cohesion and strengthens family ties, through the form of entertainment and meaningful reminders. FamJam allows families to create their own customised rooms, as a safe space for family members to interact and reach out to one another using the 5 basic functions that we have come up with. This includes our Family Schedule, Video Calls, Games, New Challenges and Helpful Resources functions, all aimed at encouraging effective communication within the family. Details about each one will be further explained in our video demonstration. 

We hope to further expand our ideas beyond FamJam in the future. This concept can be taken and applied to various other kinds of relationships. For example, a classroom setting, where students and teachers can develop greater trust and understanding for each other outside of the classroom. This requires certain modifications of the core functions that can be pivoted to prioritise healthy learning whilst still maintaining a fun environment in which to do so. 

Unfortunately, our team was unable to proceed with app development due to time constraints, we came up with a Figma prototype instead. Here is the link to our prototype: https://www.figma.com/file/mPl4ur40kOaPU01QKwy0M9/PowerPuffs-FamJam?node-id=0%3A1
